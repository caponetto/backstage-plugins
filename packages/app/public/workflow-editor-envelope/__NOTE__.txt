This folder (`public/workflow-editor-envelope`) must not be pushed to source control.
It is auto generated by the `export-workflow-editor-envelope:embedded` script from the orchestrator plugin.

However, it has been pushed to `KOGITO-9778-setup` branch only to make the local envelope available out of the box.
